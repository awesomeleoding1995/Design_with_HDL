## Introduction

In this lab session, we created a program to display a re-configurable picture via HDMI by using FPGA and Analog Devices ADV7513 HDMI Transmitter. Two IP blocks were used, PLL block for generating different frequency clock and ROM block for creating lookup table.

A functional block diagram showed below is a diagram illustrates the systemâ€™s overall inputs and outputs.
