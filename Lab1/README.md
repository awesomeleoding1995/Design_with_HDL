This lab basically demonstrates how to convert a truth table to a equivalent Boolean expression of SOP (sum of products) using
shcematic capture in the Intel Quartus Prime platform. A simple waveform simulation will be conducted as well on Quartus.
After finishing the implementation, a demonstration on DE10-Nano is requested.
