##Introduction

Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) is the topic of this lab, which contains the goals as followed:

• design a seven-segment decoder with Verilog 

• simulate the function of Verilog code 

• implement and verify the BCD decoder on DE-10 Development board

To realize the BCD function on board, one of the key points is to organise the seven-segment LED display properly, illuminating different segments to display decimal numbers refer to their binary equivalents. Since the cathodes of LEDs are tied together on the DE-10, they will be illuminated as their values are set to logic 1.
