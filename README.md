# Design_with_HDL
This repository records the process that I learned Hardware Design Language (Verilog) in RMIT, which contains the laboratory sessions and exercises. All solutions for each lab are provided by Li and collaborators.

## Introduction
The Design with Hardware Description Language is a course that utilise Verilog HDL and Tcl to introduce and practise digital circuit design. With a great amount of hands-on exprience, the course content are demonstrated. 

The basic development board used in this course is the DE10-Nano Development Kit provided by Terasic.
